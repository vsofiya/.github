This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to any of the code maintainers.


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available 
> * [ink! Documentation]([Docs](https://use.ink/))
> * [ink! Docs.rs](https://docs.rs/ink/4.0.0/ink/)
> * [StackExchange - ink!](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ink)
> * [aWASoMe references](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/aWASoMe)

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing **Issues** that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an Issue.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs


#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the supported combination od `ink!`,  `rustc`, `cargo-contract`.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions. If you are looking for support, you might want to check [I have a question](#i-have-a-question) chapter in this document.
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug. Search the whole SwankyHub organization since the bug can be same on different repositories.
- Also make sure to search the internet (including [Stack Exchange](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ink)) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?


#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent to code maintainers.


We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).




### Suggesting New Project

This section guides you through submitting a new project/repository to Swanky Hub.
Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion.


#### Before Submitting a new Project

- Make sure that you understand existing project in the Swanky Hub.
- Your repository should be related to ink! smart contract and dApp development.
- Your repository should bring something new to the community.


#### How Do I Submit a Good Project Suggestion?

Use the following checklist to help you create a new suggestion:

* [ ] Use a **clear, descriptive and short title** for the repository.
* [ ] Make a simple Github action (CI) for your repository.
* [ ] Cover your code with ink! unit test
* [ ] Code which is not covered with ink! unit test must be covered with `ink_e2e` test
* [ ] Add README.md and format it similar to existing projects
* [ ] Add LICENSE file
* [ ] Use latest version of ink! and cargo-contract
* [ ] Add `rust-toolchain.toml` file to describe the rust version



- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. 
- **Explain why your project would be good fit for Swanky Hub**
